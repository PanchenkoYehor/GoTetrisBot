# TetrisBot

## How to run?

The first step is to installation Go from https://golang.org/doc/install.

Then, as usual in "Golang" through the command line, run

`go get github.com/PanchenkoYehor/GoTetrisBot` 

Then run

`go run github.com/PanchenkoYehor/GoTetrisBot` 

## What's the problem?

If it **does not** work, you have the other command line settings than mine. You could move to the directory "*User*", then "*User's name*", then "*go*" and "*bin*". There you will see the executable file "*GoTetrisBot.exe*". Just execute him directly by double-clicking.
