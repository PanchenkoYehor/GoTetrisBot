# TetrisBot

## How to run?

As usual in "Golang"

`go get github.com/PanchenkoYehor/GoTetrisBot` 

Then run

`go run github.com/PanchenkoYehor/GoTetrisBot` 

## What's the problem?

The problem is that you maybe couldn't run code by the way like above. I don't know how to resolve it and need some help.

You could try to download all project and run it on your PC. That should work.

In any case, you could write me, and we will try to think together what to do)
